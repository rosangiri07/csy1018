The index page should be the landing page of the website and should contain links to different other pages.The contact page should include the contact address and google map location of your position.The about page should include your biography and inspiration as a developer. The social page should include the links to your social media. The model page is your report page and should open in another tab.</p>

	<h3>2.UI Design</h3>
	<p>UI stands for User Interface Design. The main goal of UI is to make things simpler, attractive and more user friendly. Nowadays UI is used in every sector. It is used in design of vehicles, projets and so on. Due to the development of UI the life of people have become easy and it helps to solve their problem. The do not have to make complex work and through UI complex works can be done in a easy way.Through UI design the pages can be made responsive which means that a webpage can be easily accessible in all devices.<br>
	UI have helped me a lot through my assignment. It had made my work easier, faster and more convinient. Through UI design I have used different properties like hover and making my page responsive in all devices.These are some of the websites that I took help to begin my assignment:

	<h3>3.Groupwork</h3>
	<p>We have a few member of groups and we discuss our problems within the group.However, we only discuss our problems but we do not share the codes. We discuss about the problems that we were facing during the assignment and we deal how to overcome these problems.The main advantage of groupwork is that the problem can be solved in very short period of time which can be very beneficial for us. But, there is also disvantage of groupwork. One of the disadvantage of groupwork is that the groupmember rely on us everytime they face a problem. They do not try to solve their problems at first. Directly they come to the group and represent their problems.</p>

<h3>9.Conclusion</h3>
<p>There are six pages to be made in this assignment. All the pages are made and the pages are checked whether they are responsive or not. The evidence of responsive is shown above in the report. The report page contains the wireframes and design of index, contact, about, cv, social and model. Responsive wireframes are also included in this report. Mock-ups of the webpages are taken screenshot and is included in the report. Similarly responsive mock-ups are also made and the evidence can be shown above in the report.</p>
<p>The six pages are also validated and the evidence is shown above in the report. All the information such as loading time is included in the webpage validation.The validation is done through w3 validation.</p>
<p>Before creating these pages many research were done. Many tools,widgets were tested and finally this webpage was created. If the time was long enough than I think I could have make the pages much better. </p>
<p>
The first term material was enough to make these pages. We learn about how to put files in github. We learn about Css, creating a form,google material design,css3 and a introduction about javascript. I think that these materials were enough for us to create these webpages.
