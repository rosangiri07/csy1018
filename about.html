			<p> 
			My name is Roshan Giri and I am a student. My permanent address is Kathmandu. I have cleared my SLC examination from West Point High School and +2 level from Kathmandu Model College. I am currently studying at Naya Aayam Multidisciplinary Institute. This institute is affiliated to University Of Northampton. I am studying Bsc Computing in this institute. This course contains six modules. From early age I have interest in programming and now that I am fulfilling my dream. I want to an It analyst. I have taken programming language classes. I have taken programming language classes after clearing my school level. I am very much inspired from Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. I want to be like them in the future. I want to be a great programmer in life.

			I have diffrent hobbies. I like to play football, basketball, badmintion, table-tennis and so on. I believe that focusing on only studying makes your mind dull so we should paricipate in extra curricular activities to sharpen and brighten our mind. I have won table-tennis match as an individual player and as a team I have won matches in basketball and football. I also like to go hiking from time to time. The thing that I most like about hiking is that It makes our mind and body sound and sharp.
